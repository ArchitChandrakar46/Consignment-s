                <h2>Consignment Brief</h2>
                <p>A consignment refers to a commercial arrangement in which goods are sent by one party (the consignor) to
                 another (the consignee) for the purpose of sale. However, ownership of the goods remains with the consignor 
                 until they are sold, at which point the consignee receives a share of the proceeds. 
                 This arrangement is common in various industries, such as retail and art.</p>
                 <p>Ownership: The consignor retains ownership of the goods until they are sold. This is different from a traditional sale where ownership is transferred immediately.</p>

                <p>Risk and Rewards: The consignee takes on the risk of storing and selling the goods, but they also have the potential to earn a profit from the sale.</p>
                    
                <p>Payment: The consignee usually receives a commission or a percentage of the sale price as compensation for selling the goods. This commission is the consignee's reward for their efforts and the risks they take.</p>
                    
                <p>Unsold Goods: If the goods are not sold within a specified period, they may be returned to the consignor or other arrangements can be made regarding their disposal.</p>
                    
                <p>Accounting: Consignment transactions require careful accounting to track the movement of goods, sales, and revenue. Both parties need to maintain accurate records of the consignment arrangement</p>

            <aside>
            Consignment arrangements are beneficial for both parties. For the consignor, 
            it allows them to reach a broader market without the risk of upfront costs, and for the consignee, 
            it provides an opportunity to earn a commission by selling products without having to purchase inventory.
